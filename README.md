# ruff_parser
A very simple project that accepts output from a `ruff` summary and turns it into a summarized report.

I needed this for a suite of tests and wanted to turn it into a simple Rust learning experience.

Currently, there is no autobuild and no uploaded binaries. When I have more time, I'll be adding these.
